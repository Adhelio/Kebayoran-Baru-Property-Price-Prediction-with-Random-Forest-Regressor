# Kebayoran Baru Property Price Prediction with Random Forest Regressor
This project was performed by a team of 4 students as a condition for graduating a course of the 3rd & 4th Semesters, Data Analysis and Data Modelling. I was responsible for reviewing previous researches, prepare the data by removing missing values and outliers with the IQR method. I'm also responsible for constructing predictive model for the data using Random Forest Regressor, improve its performance by hyperparameter tuning using grid search cross validation, as well as deploying the model as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
